Data tools: this is more or less presented below how our products currently are, but in combining, a few major questions arise:
- Do we want to name this section something that communicates that this is about browsing, interacting with, and visualizing comprehensive datasets? 
- Do 'Neighborhood Reports' belog in here? 
- Does it make sense to keep EpiQuery as 'one product' or rather, separate it out into: Survey Data, Disease Data, and Vital Statistics?
