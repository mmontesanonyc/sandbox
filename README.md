Rebuild the Nav Menu. 

Destroy content and create new top-level pages for:
    - Data Tools
        - EpiQuery
        - EH
        - NRs
    - Topics
        - So many...! Add a search, then list things wildly.
    - Dashboards
        - Just start listing out
    - Publications
        - Rough categories

Then, rebuild nav menu

Questions:
- What's the right way to organize and label content?
- What are the difference between major data tools, and dashboards? 
- Are neighborhood reports a 'major data tool' or a dashboard? Or their own thing?
