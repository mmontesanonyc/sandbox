Collecting all publications here would allow us to build a much more intuitive tagging, searching, and browsing functionality. Questions arise:
- Does it make sense to sort these into these different 'branded' names, or can these just be tags used to filter? 
- How do we handle old PDFs? Do we want to convert some recent ones into web content? Do we want to publish future ones as web content? If old ones remain as PDFs, each should get its own page for tagging, search, and integration.
